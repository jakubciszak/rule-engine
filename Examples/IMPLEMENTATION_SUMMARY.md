## Technical Features Demonstrated

### Rule Engine APIs
- **NestedRuleApi**: Complex business logic with nested conditions
- **FlatRuleAPI**: Performance-critical rule evaluation with RPN
- **StringRuleApi**: Human-readable infix expressions

### Business Logic Patterns
- Action-based variable modification (`.risk_score + 25`)
- Conditional workflows with multiple criteria
- Risk accumulation and scoring systems
- Automated decision trees
- Escalation and approval hierarchies

### Real-World Scenarios
- Age-based risk assessment (young/elderly customers)
- Income verification and anomaly detection
- Document expiry and quality checks
- Geographic risk evaluation (high-risk countries)
- Sanctions list screening (OFAC, EU, UN)
- PEP and adverse media screening
- Enhanced due diligence triggers
- Final risk-based onboarding decisions

## Business Value

### Financial Compliance
